                                            <p>Are you looking to learn WordPress and build a website? One of the best parts about WordPress is it’s ease of use. Learning WordPress does not require a lot of time or money. In this article, we will show you how to learn WordPress for free in a week (or less).</p>
                                            <h4>Why Learn WordPress?</h4>
                                            <p>WordPress is the world’s most popular open source content management system. That’s a fancy of saying it allows you to build great websites. </p>
                                            <p>About 22% of all websites are powered by WordPress. It generates thousands of job opportunities around the world, and there are millions of websites making money using WordPress. </p>
                                            <p>Apart from the economic opportunities, WordPress enables people to share their stories, ideas, build communities and do awesome things.</p>
                                            <h4>What do I need to learn WordPress?</h4>
                                            <p>Learning WordPress is easy as long as you are willing to commit few hours each day for a week. You would need some very basic search skills (i.e know how to Google), and the ability to follow instructions.</p>
                                            <p>No you don’t need to know HTML or other programming to build a website. Will it help to know those in the future? Ofcourse, but it’s not necessary in the beginning.</p>
                                            <p>Many skilled WordPress users started from scratch just like you. In fact most WordPress users don’t know how to write code or design websites. </p>
                                            <p>Now that you are committed to learn WordPress, we want to welcome you to the awesome WordPress community.</p>
                                            <p>Let’s start…   </p>
                                            <h4>Monday: Initial Setup</h4>

                                            <p>The first thing you need to do is install and setup WordPress.

                                            <p>The real power of WordPress is in the plugins. WordPress plugins allow you to expand your website functionality such as adding contact forms, create a store, etc.</p>
                                            <p>There are more than 32,000 free plugins available in the official WordPress plugin repository alone.

                                            <h4>Thursday: Using WordPress Themes</h4>
                                            <p><img src="http://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wordpress-themes.jpg" alt="Using WordPress Themes" width="520" height="309" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21979" title="Using WordPress Themes"></p>
                                            <p>WordPress themes control the look of your website. Themes are pre-made templates that you can install and customize for your site. </p>
                                            <p>There are thousands of free and premium themes available for WordPress. You can download free themes from the <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/" title="WordPress Themes Directory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WordPress Themes directory</a>. For premium themes, you can go to theme shops like <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/studiopress/" target="_blank" title="StudioPress" rel="nofollow">StudioPress</a>, <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/elegantthemes/" target="_blank" title="Elegant Themes" rel="nofollow">Elegant Themes</a>, <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/themify/" target="_blank" title="Themify" rel="nofollow">Themify</a>, etc. </p>
                                            <p>A perfect theme should be a balance of beautiful design and powerful features. Too many features are not always a good sign for Theme. Check out our guide on choosing the <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-themes/selecting-the-perfect-theme-for-wordpress/" title="Selecting the Perfect Theme for WordPress">perfect WordPress theme</a> for your website.</p>
                                            <p>Refer back to our WordPress videos from Tuesday to see how you can change background, add header images, add menus, and more in your WordPress theme.</p>
